### What is Pairs Trading?

Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that matches a long position with a short position in two historically correlated stocks. It profits from temporary mispricings while being relatively hedged against market movements.

---

### Why Choose Pairs Trading?

- Market neutral
- Statistical arbitrage
- Diversified and controllable risk
- Proven historical profitability

---

### Pair Stock Selection

##### Same industry
- Similar fundamentals, Business models, Financial profiles

##### Statistical method
- Suppose P denotes the closing price of stock i at time t, where formation period t = 0,1,…,T
  - Calculate standardized prices for stocks
  - Calculate SSD of the standardized prices for stocks X and Y
  - Select pairs with minimum SSD

---

### Setting Trading Rules

##### Calculate 𝜇 and 𝜎
- Compute the mean and standard deviation of the standardized stock price spread during the formation period

##### Open position
- Standardized price spread between the two stocks < 𝜇−1.5𝜎 or > 𝜇+1.5𝜎

##### Close position
- If < 𝜇−1.5𝜎 , close position when the Standardized price spread back to 𝜇−0.2𝜎
- If > 𝜇+1.5𝜎 , close position when the Standardized price spread back to 𝜇+0.2𝜎

##### Stop-loss line
  - If standardized price spread < 𝜇−2.5𝜎 or > 𝜇+2.5𝜎 after open position, we close position to stop loss.

##### Draw Standardized Price Spread Series Chart
  - Normalized spreads, averages, opening lines, closing lines, and stop-loss lines.

### Refinements and Advanced Methods

##### Pair Identifier
- Clustering: K-means, how to select hyperparam
- GNN: Stocks as nodes, pair relation as line, sector as subgraph
- Attention combined

##### Spread Construction
- Move beyond linear spread
- Use multi-factor approaches (fundamentals, technical indicators)

##### Signal Generation
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) for end-to-end decision making
- Ensemble learning for robustness

##### Capital Allocation
- Multi-objective optimization

##### Dynamic portfolio
- Rerank to fix unstable Pair relation
- Risk-contribution clear out

### Data Example

- We selected the 150 most traded stocks from the S&P500 and made sure that each stock had ten years of trading data for our subsequent pair selection.
