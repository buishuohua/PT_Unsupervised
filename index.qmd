### What is Pairs Trading?

Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that matches a long position with a short position in two historically correlated stocks. It profits from temporary mispricings while being relatively hedged against market movements.

---

### Why Choose Pairs Trading?

- Market neutral
- Statistical arbitrage
- Diversified and controllable risk
- Proven historical profitability

---

### Pair Stock Selection

- **Same industry:**
  - Similar fundamentals, Business models, Financial profiles

- **Statistical method:**
Suppose P denotes the closing price of stock i at time t, where formation period t = 0,1,…,T
  - Calculate standardized prices for stocks
  - Calculate SSD of the standardized prices for stocks X and Y
  - Select pairs with minimum SSD

---

### Setting Trading Rules

- **Calculate 𝜇 and 𝜎**
  - Compute the mean and standard deviation of the standardized stock price spread during the formation period

- **Open position**
  - Standardized price spread between the two stocks < 𝜇−1.5𝜎 or > 𝜇+1.5𝜎

- **Close position**
  - If < 𝜇−1.5𝜎 , close position when the Standardized price spread back to 𝜇−0.2𝜎
  - If > 𝜇+1.5𝜎 , close position when the Standardized price spread back to 𝜇+0.2𝜎

- **Stop-loss line**
  - If standardized price spread < 𝜇−2.5𝜎 or > 𝜇+2.5𝜎 after open position, we close position to stop loss.

- **Draw Standardized Price Spread Series Chart**
  - Normalized spreads, averages, opening lines, closing lines, and stop-loss lines.

### Refinements and Advanced Methods

- **Pair Identifier**
  - Clustering: K-means, how to select hyperparam
  - GNN: Stocks as nodes, pair relation as line, sector as subgraph
  - Attention combined

- **Spread Construction**
  - Move beyond linear spread
  - Use multi-factor approaches (fundamentals, technical indicators)

- **Signal Generation**
  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) for end-to-end decision making
  - Ensemble learning for robustness

- **Capital Allocation**
  - Multi-objective optimization

- **Dynamic portfolio**
  - Rerank to fix unstable Pair relation
  - Risk-contribution clear out
