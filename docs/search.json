It profits from temporary mispricings while being relatively hedged against market movements.\n\n\n\nWhy Choose Pairs Trading?\n\nMarket neutral\nStatistical arbitrage\nDiversified and controllable risk\nProven historical profitability\n\n\n\n\nPair Stock Selection\n\nSame industry\n\nSimilar fundamentals, Business models, Financial profiles\n\n\n\nStatistical method\n\nSuppose P denotes the closing price of stock i at time t, where formation period t = 0,1,…,T\n\nCalculate standardized prices for stocks\nCalculate SSD of the standardized prices for stocks X and Y\nSelect pairs with minimum SSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Trading Rules\n\nCalculate 𝜇 and 𝜎\n\nCompute the mean and standard deviation of the standardized stock price spread during the formation period\n\n\n\nOpen position\n\nStandardized price spread between the two stocks &lt; 𝜇−1.5𝜎 or &gt; 𝜇+1.5𝜎\n\n\n\nClose position\n\nIf &lt; 𝜇−1.5𝜎 , close position when the Standardized price spread back to 𝜇−0.2𝜎\nIf &gt; 𝜇+1.5𝜎 , close position when the Standardized price spread back to 𝜇+0.2𝜎\n\n\n\nStop-loss line\n\nIf standardized price spread &lt; 𝜇−2.5𝜎 or &gt; 𝜇+2.5𝜎 after open position, we close position to stop loss.\n\n\n\nDraw Standardized Price Spread Series Chart\n\nNormalized spreads, averages, opening lines, closing lines, and stop-loss lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefinements and Advanced Methods\n\nPair Identifier\n\nClustering: K-means, how to select hyperparam\nGNN: Stocks as nodes, pair relation as line, sector as subgraph\nAttention combined\n\n\n\nSpread Construction\n\nMove beyond linear spread\nUse multi-factor approaches (fundamentals, technical indicators)\n\n\n\nSignal Generation\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) for end-to-end decision making\nEnsemble learning for robustness\n\n\n\nCapital Allocation\n\nMulti-objective optimization\n\n\n\nDynamic portfolio\n\nRerank to fix unstable Pair relation\nRisk-contribution clear out\n\n\n\n\n\nData Example\n\nWe selected the 150 most traded stocks from the S&P500 and made sure that each stock had ten years of trading data for our subsequent pair selection.\n\n\n\nStocks We Choose\n\n\nHere are 10 of the 150 stocks, we used one day of data as an example showing open, high, low, close, volumn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstock_idx\ndate\nopen\nhigh\nlow\nclose\nvolume\n\n\n\n\nAAPL\n2025-04-08\n186.70\n190.34\n179.62\n187.90\n120859994\n\n\nAMCR\n2025-04-08\n16.78\n17.22\n16.41\n17.21\n42828334\n\n\nAMD\n2025-04-08\n96.72\n98.66\n93.52\n95.22\n46283727\n\n\nAMZN\n2025-04-08\n185.23\n186.93\n178.57\n183.98\n58888478\n\n\nAVGO\n2025-04-08\n167.25\n169.53\n157.89\n162.91\n53127980\n\n\nBAC\n2025-04-08\n55.74\n56.23\n54.71\n55.89\n42930823\n\n\nC\n2025-04-08\n52.39\n53.64\n50.21\n52.28\n38929745\n\n\nCCL\n2025-04-08\n17.45\n18.12\n16.72\n17.97\n27893145\n\n\nCMCSA\n2025-04-08\n40.73\n41.98\n39.22\n40.56\n35142789\n\n\nCSCO\n2025-04-08\n52.26\n52.97\n51.69\n52.10\n29473815"
